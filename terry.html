                    Terry Davis was a man who really loved computers. He knew how to talk to them in a way most of us can't understand. He was born on December 15, 1969, and grew up at a time when computers were just starting to become popular in people's homes. Terry was so good at working with computers that he went to university and got a master's degree in electrical engineering.

                    But instead of getting a normal job like many people do after university, Terry wanted to make his own path. He had a big dream: to build his own computer system from scratch. And he did just that. He called it TempleOS. Terry said that God gave him the idea for this system. He wanted it to be a special place where he could talk to God. This might sound strange, but for Terry, it was very important.

                    He worked on TempleOS for many years, writing all the instructions for the computer himself. These instructions were written in a special computer language that Terry invented, which he named HolyC. The computer system looked simple with its black and white screen and simple graphics, but it was actually very complex and could do a lot of things.

                    Terry was not just dealing with computers. He also had a big challenge in his life. He had schizophrenia, which is a condition that makes it hard for a person to tell what's real and what's not. This made his life very hard sometimes. He would share his thoughts and feelings with people online, and sometimes these thoughts were very confusing or upsetting to others.

                <br>
                <p>
                    But even with these challenges, Terry kept working on his dream. He shared his work with the world on the internet. Some people didn't understand him, but others really admired how smart he was and how much he could do with computers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    His life was not easy, and sometimes he made people upset because he said or did things that were unusual. But Terry was not just his illness; he was also his talents and his dreams. He showed us that even when life gives you big challenges, you can still do amazing things.
                </p>

                    Terry's life ended too soon; he passed away in August 2018. But he left behind his TempleOS, which is like a big puzzle that shows us how much he knew about computers and how creative he could be. His story is about more than just a man and his computer system. It's a story about having the courage to follow your dreams, even when the path is hard. It's a reminder that people who think differently can make something beautiful and meaningful. Terry's life was a mix of great talent and tough times, and it's a story that can inspire us all.
